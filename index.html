<div align="center">

    <p> Input your polygon by clicking in the center of the screen. Please input only simple Polygons and enter the points in counterclockwise order. If the polygon is not entered correctly... anything could happen. Please note that any empty entries in the filled section of the table correspond to triangulations of a concave polygon that include line segments outside of the polygon. </p>

    <p>In order to run this applet, you will need to add the site to your list of security exceptions in the Java control panel (Mac: System Preferences -> Java, Windows: Start -> Configure Java). That is because I have refused to pay $200 for a code signing certificate. Luckily, this is a Github page so you can access all of the code and verify for yourself that it's completely harmless.

    Alternatively, feel free to simply clone the repo and run the code yourself.
